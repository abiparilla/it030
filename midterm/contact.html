    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Hi! My name is Abigail Parilla and I am a sophomore at Hofstra University, pursuing a Bachelor of Business Administration in Information Systems. Based in Long Island, NY, I have always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and beauty, especially when it comes to skincare.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">My interest in skincare started as a personal journey, but it quickly grew into something more. I love learning about new products, ingredients, and routines that promote healthy, glowing skin. Whether it is testing the latest serums or researching the science behind skincare innovations, I believe that taking care of your skin is a form of self-care and confidence.</p>
    <p style="text-align: left;">Through my website, I hope to share insights, tips, and recommendations to help others achieve their best skin. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out!</p>
