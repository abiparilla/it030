                <h3>Good condition</h3>
                <p>You're shedding skin cells throughout the day, so it's important to keep your skin glowing and in good condition. An effective routine can help prevent acne, treat wrinkles, and help keep your skin looking its best.</p>

                <h3>Youthful look</h3>
                <p>As you age, your skin's cells turn over more slowly, making it look duller and less radiant. Using a quality skin care line can help remove dead skin cells so your body will replace them with newer, more youthful cells.</p>

        <h2>5 Steps to Clear Skin</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong> Cleansers:</strong>  Removes dead skin, pollutants, oil, dirt, and bacteria. Avoid cleansers that have sulfates, which can be stripped. If you have sensitive skin, choose a fragrance-free cleanser.</li>
            <li><strong> Toners:</strong>  Acts as a balancer to remove dirt, bacteria, makeup, and other impurities that your cleanser may have left behind. Using a toner can give your skin an extra-deep clean, and it protects the skin.</li>
            <li><strong> Essences, serums, and ampoules:</strong>  Essences hydrate and prep the skin, serums target specific concerns with concentrated ingredients, and ampoules are even more potent, used for intensive treatments or when skin needs a boost.</li>
            <li><strong> Moisturizer:</strong>  Hydrates dry skin and can improve the skin barrier. Moisturizers with antiaging ingredients can also soothe sensitive skin and improve skin tone and texture while helping skin to look firmer and healthier.</li>
            <li><strong> Sunscreen:</strong>  Protects the skin from the harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays emitted by the sun. UV rays can cause sunburn, premature aging, and an increased risk of skin cancer.</li>
        </ol>
